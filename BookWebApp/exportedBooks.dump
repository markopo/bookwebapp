There is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. Planning is vital, so you''ll also learn how to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops.

You''ll learn about the wide range of HTML elements available to you, and you''ll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS gives you the ability to set your website apart from the rest while maintaining the integrity of your markup. You''ll learn how CSS works and how to apply styles to your pages, enabling you to realize your design ideas in the browser.

While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and the book explains how best to do these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life-cycle. The book concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available and explaining differences between available products. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, this book provides invaluable information applicable to every web project, regardless of size, scope, or budget.','1430209925','9781430209928',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=295iDEn7YCYC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',NULL,'en','CSS');

INSERT INTO "Book" VALUES(163115,'Core CSS','core-css','Keith Schengili-Roberts','Prentice Hall Professional',NULL,'Preface Welcome to the second edition of Core CSS. When the initial edition came out in 2000, while CSS had been around for a few years, it was largely underutilized on the Web. And there was a good reason for this: browser support for CSS properties was, to put it kindly, "spotty." In the past few years things have changed substantially: the Mozilla project pushed for a standards-compliant rendering engine—including CSS—that has since been incorporated into the most recent versions of Netscape Navigator; and Internet Explorer 5.0 and later 6.0 made real advances in supporting CSS properties. As older, non-CSS-compliant browsers fade into the background, Web design has advanced accordingly and is beginning to take full advantage of the formatting possibilities that CSS opens up for both eye-popping and better functioning Web sites. While the browser manufacturers have been playing "catch-up" and have largely (with some notable exceptions) instituted the CSS1 and CSS2 standards devised by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the W3C has not stood still. While still in draft status, the various modules that will one day comprise the CSS3 specification are well on the way towards providing a comprehensive set of tools for Web authors seeking to format just about anything and everything you can think of that has to do with a Web page. While none of these CSS3 modules have been finalized—and things may still change substantially—many of the new directions that are being charted by the W3C in this area are covered in this book as a "heads up" as to what future Web developers can come to expect. One of the original reasons behind the creation of CSS was to prevent competing browsers developers from the runaway development of new HTML tags that only worked in their particular browser. This has seemingly not stopped the temptation by browser manufacturers to continue to "push the envelope," and in particular, recent versions of Microsoft''s Internet Explorer have included a number of browser-specific CSS properties. These are covered in the various sections of the book, both out of a sense of completeness as well as wanting to provide readers who may be working in a "closed-shop" environment (i.e., where they know that their clients are all using this browser) with information they can genuinely use. As a member of the W3C, Microsoft is also helping to chart the progress of the future CSS development, and many as yet browser-specific CSS properties may not be so in the future. When I am asked why I write computer books, I usually respond that I write books I wished already existed that I could use daily in my work. A number of books have appeared since the first edition of Core CSS came out, but none of them have been as comprehensive—especially when it came to covering CSS2 or Internet Explorer properties—as I would have liked. The majority of the code in the first book has been completely re-written for this edition, and dozens more examples better show what particular CSS properties can do and how they work—or do not work—in modern browsers. Who You Are You are a Web author who is looking to expand the capabilities of your Web pages. You know that CSS opens the doors to a wide range of possibilities, but want to learn more about how to make the most of it. Or perhaps you know that CSS will solve some of your most pernicious Web formatting problems, but shy away from using it because you have heard that it can produce varying results when viewed under different browsers or under different operating systems. Maybe you are looking for a single source that tells you what you need to know about a property at a glance, instead of having to traverse a dozen Web sites to get the same information. If you fit any of these circumstances, then this book is for you. This book takes a practical, pragmatic look at the current state of affairs regarding CSS and guides the reader through how CSS works. This book provides the information Web authors need in order to understand not only how CSS should work, but also how it actually works in current major browsers. It does not confine itself only to one operating system, but takes a look at how CSS works under browsers working under multiple operating systems. With this knowledge, Web authors will know which CSS properties are "safe" for use, and which to avoid. More than that though, this book also provides information as to the future of CSS with an in-depth look at what will likely prove to be the foundation of the future CSS3 specification. You do not have to be an expert at understanding how Web pages work, but the book does assume you have a basic understanding of both HTML and the Web. The book assumes no prior knowledge of CSS. It will not only serve those Web authors who are just starting out using CSS, but also act as a handy reference for those occasions when you need to look up how a particular CSS property works. How This Book Is Organized The first edition of this book separated CSS1 and CSS2 properties. Now that much of CSS2 has been adopted within the major browsers, it no longer made sense to keep things separate. This has been extended further to include draft CSS3 properties into the (sometimes rough) families of properties to which they belong. While these properties are not currently in use—and some of them may not end up looking the same as they do in this book when they are finally released—they are important as an indicator of the way CSS development is progressing, so that forwardlooking Web authors can get a heads up. The CSS3 properties outlined here are my "best guesses" based on my own Web-authoring experience. In some cases there are wholly separate chapters devoted to Internet Explorer-only CSS properties, but many of them fall into already-defined families of properties and are included in those chapters. In addition to all of the chapters in this book are some appendices designed to provide the Web author with quick reference material to have on hand when writing CSS code. Chapter 1 ("The Birth of CSS") explores how CSS in its current form came to be. The following two chapters (Chapter 2, "(X)HTML and Its Relationship to CSS" and Chapter 3, "Browser Adoption of CSS") provide information on how CSS can be accessed within Web page code, and how the major browser manufacturers have increasingly adopted CSS within their browsers. Chapter 4 ("Implementation of Basic CSS Concepts") looks at how some of the basic concepts behind CSS—such as inheritance, grouping CSS code and cascading rules—are implemented in the major browsers. Chapters 5 and 6 ("The Cascade" and "CSS Units," respectively) extend this concept further by looking at how the "C" of "CSS" works, and explains the many different fundamental units of measure that can be used in conjunction with certain CSS properties. Chapter 7 ("Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements") looks at how these CSS elements which allow for special or conditional types of formatting can be utilized. Chapter 8 ("Media Types and Media Queries") introduces the concept of media types and examines how Web pages can be modified so that they can be displayed through such things as print or "talking browsers." Chapters 9 and 10 ("Font Properties" and "Text Properties") begin the "meat and potatoes" part of the book for most readers, looking in detail at the properties used daily by an increasing number of Web authors. Chapter 11 ("Text Property Extensions") is the first chapter devoted wholly to Internet Explorer-specific properties, most of which are aimed at formatting Web pages for an international audience. Chapter 12 ("Box Properties") brings us back to the "meat and potatoes" area of CSS formatting, explaining in detail the box set CSS properties, which can determine how a wide variety of Web elements such as headers, images and paragraphs can be enhanced. The topic of Chapter 13 ("Color") used to be part of the background family of properties, but the draft CSS3 module has charted a new course for using color on the Web, all of which is looked at in this section. Background properties—including a number of draft CSS innovations in this area—are covered in Chapter 14 ("Background Properties"). Chapter 15 ("Classification Properties and Generated/Automatic Content") is the start of what for many readers will be the more esoteric uses to which CSS can be put to, and yet represents much of where the real rendering power behind CSS lies. This chapter looks at how its functions enable Web authors to control and enhance content that is automatically generated by the browser, including such things as the numbering and display of lists. Chapter 16 ("Visual Formatting and Detailed Visual Formatting") represents the core of what is popularly known as the "CSS positioning" properties. Chapter 17 ("Visual Effects") looks primarily at properties designed to produce stunning effects using dynamic code. Chapter 18 ("Paged Media") explores those properties related to crafting Web pages so that they can be printed (rather than displayed on a screen) in the precise way that a Web author desires. Chapter 19 ("Tables") looks at the somewhat rag-tag collection of table-related formatting properties, but then rounds off the chapter by looking at ways of creating table-like formatting structures using only CSS. In addition to covering what is already possible to do with user-interface properties in Chapter 20 ("User Interface")—such as providing greater control over the display of such things as cursors and the outlines that surround buttons or text fields in forms that denote a "focus" for user input—it also includes an extensive preview as to how you can affect the functionality of Web pages when now-draft CSS3 properties become available. Mastering the properties covered in these sections guarantees that you will be at the forefront of CSS-based Web design. Chapter 21 ("Aural Cascading Style Sheets") begins a section of the book covering either under-implemented CSS properties or those specific to working with a particular browser. This chapter explores a relatively new class of properties designed to enable the Web author to determine how a Web page could be spoken aloud by a browser with speech capabilities—sadly, this is poorly implemented in the major browsers. Chapter 22 ("Ruby") looks at the properties used in formatting a particular type of Chinese text layout; these properties are specific to Internet Explorer but are now being actively considered by the W3C for inclusion in the future CSS3 specification. Columnar layout properties, based in part on some old browser-specific HTML tags in Netscape Navigator, are explored in Chapter 23 ("Multi-Column Layout"). Chapter 24 ("Scrollbars") briefly looks at some properties designed to change the appearance of scrollbars specific to recent versions of Internet Explorer. The final chapter (Chapter 25 "Filters and Transitions") is a sizable one devoted to Internet Explorer''s CSS-based way of adding some interesting and often dynamic visual effects. Appendix A is a CSS compatibility chart, looking at all of the "Safe," "Unsafe" and "Partial"-ly implemented CSS1 and CSS2 properties for various versions of the browsers Web authors are likely to run into. Appendix B provides an alphabetical listing of all CSS1, CSS2 and Internet Explorer CSS properties (minus the admittedly oddball filter and transition properties) as a quick reference. Appendix C looks at the CSS3 Mobile Profile and contains properties that are expected to be implemented in scaled-down browsers intended for use while "on the go."','0130092789','9780130092786',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LMN8duabVGcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',NULL,'en','CSS');

INSERT INTO "Book" VALUES(163333,'JavaScript Object Programming','javascript-object-programming','Martin Rinehart','Apress',NULL,'This brief book explains the advantages of the object model, inheritance, both classical and prototypical, and shows how these concepts can be implemented in JavaScript. It also shows how object programming (OP) opens a new world of design possibilities that go far beyond inheritance. This book will help the intermediate JavaScript programmer learn to use both types of inheritance. For classical inheritance, it is accompanied by a substantial online system (a windowing UI library) that shows classical inheritance at its best. The same system shows how OP "capabilities" can eliminate much of the need for inheritance. For experienced JavaScript programmers, this book shows why most of the old views of JavaScript''s inheritance have not done it justice. JavaScript classes inherit from JavaScript''s prototypes, a fact that makes JavaScript''s prototypes, when used correctly, functional equivalents to C++ classes (not to prototypes in true prototypical languages, like Self). JavaScript''s object programming (not inheritance) is what separates it from classical OOP languages like C++ and Java. Most important, basing inheritance on JavaScript''s prototypal chain is possible, but is not the best choice for prototypal inheritance or classical inheritance.

Gain a solid understanding of architecture and SPA design to build applications using the library or framework of your choice. Explore the various facets of SPA development to build web apps that are fast, scalable, and easy to test. Who This Book Is For This book is ideal for JavaScript developers who want to build complex single-page applications in JavaScript. Some basic understanding of SPA concepts will be helpful but not essential. What You Will Learn Organize your development environment using the command line with NPM, Bower, and Grunt. Choose an accurate design pattern for your app Understand modular JavaScript programming and Node.js Interact with a REST API using JavaScript and AJAX with practical examples Build a single page application using the MEAN stack Connect your app across popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn Test your app, both on the server side and in views Prepare your app for the real world and deploy it to Heroku In Detail Single-page web applications—or SPAs, as they are commonly referred to—are quickly becoming the de facto standard for web app development. The fact that a major part of the app runs inside a single web page makes it very interesting and appealing. Also, the accelerated growth of browser capabilities is pushing us closer to the day when all apps will run entirely in the browser. This book will take your JavaScript development skills to the next level by teaching you to create a single-page application within a full-stack JavaScript environment. Using only JavaScript, you can go from being a front-end developer to a full-stack application developer with relative ease. You will learn to cross the boundary from front-end development to server-side development through the use of JavaScript on both ends. Use your existing knowledge of JavaScript by learning to manage a JSON document data store with MongoDB, writing a JavaScript powered REST API with Node.js and Express, and designing a front-end powered by AngularJS. This book will teach you to leverage the MEAN stack to do everything from document database design, routing REST web API requests, data-binding within views, and adding authentication and security to building a full-fledged, complex, single-page web application. In addition to building a full-stack JavaScript app, you will learn to test it with JavaScript-powered testing tools such as Mocha, Karma, and Jasmine. Finally, you will learn about deployment and scaling so that you can launch your own apps into the real world. Style and approach Following a structured approach, this book helps readers gain expertise in SPA development. Its thorough coverage of SPA architecture and design, along with practical use cases, provides readers with a clear path to building applications with the library of their choice.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that''s more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty?

You''ll learn about the wide range of HTML5 elements available to you, and you''ll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS enables you to set your website apart from the rest, while maintaining the integrity of your markup. We''ll showcase the new features of CSS3 and how you can use them. You''ll learn how CSS3 works and how to apply styles to your pages, allowing you to realize your design ideas in the browser. JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of JavaScript programming. You''ll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax, and in turn, where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture. While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and this book explains how best to accomplish these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life cycle. Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available.

All aspects of concurrent, asynchronous, and parallel programming are covered from first principles and by the end of the book you''ll be able to create a fully-worked application that leverages all the topics covered in the book. What You Will Learn Understand exactly how JavaScript works in a web browser environment, and how these mechanisms power our event-driven JavaScript code Use promises to turn complex synchronization scenarios into readable and maintainable values Compute values lazily and avoid unnecessary memory allocations using generators. Write concurrent code that doesn''t feel like concurrent code by abstracting away boilerplate chores Leverage true hardware parallelism with web workers to get a better performance Get to grips with the NodeJS model of concurrency and learn why it''s good for I/O-intensive web applications In Detail Concurrent programming may sound abstract and complex, but it helps to deliver a better user experience. With single threaded JavaScript, applications lack dynamism. This means that when JavaScript code is running, nothing else can happen. The DOM can''t update, which means the UI freezes. In a world where users expect speed and responsiveness – in all senses of the word – this is something no developer can afford. Fortunately, JavaScript has evolved to adopt concurrent capabilities – one of the reasons why it is still at the forefront of modern web development. This book helps you dive into concurrent JavaScript, and demonstrates how to apply its core principles and key techniques and tools to a range of complex development challenges. Built around the three core principles of concurrency – parallelism, synchronization, and conservation – you''ll learn everything you need to unlock a more efficient and dynamic JavaScript, to lay the foundations of even better user experiences. Throughout the book you''ll learn how to put these principles into action by using a range of development approaches. Covering everything from JavaScript promises, web workers, generators and functional programming techniques, everything you learn will have a real impact on the performance of your applications. You''ll also learn how to move between client and server, for a more frictionless and fully realized approach to development. With further guidance on concurrent programming with Node.js, JavaScript Concurrency is committed to making you a better web developer. The best developers know that great design is about more than the UI – with concurrency, you can be confident every your project will be expertly designed to guarantee its dynamism and power. Style and approach Beginning with the fundamentals of concurrency and how they apply to JavaScript development, the book then takes you through the relevant constructs that will help you implement concurrent code. You''ll learn how even the most abstract and theoretical aspects of concurrent programming help you solve real world challenges, with clear and practical demonstrations that show you how concurrent JavaScript will make you a better developer.','1785880268','9781785880261',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KjvlCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',NULL,'en','Javascript');

Because of this rapid growth in sophistication and capabilities, we''ve seen an explosion in JavaScript frameworks; the JavaScript development landscape is a fragmented one. To build large-scale JavaScript applications, we need more than just tools – we need scalable architectures. We create scalable JavaScript architectures by looking at what aspects of our application need to scale and why. Only then can we apply the best patterns and components to our architecture, scaling it into the future. JavaScript at Scale will show you how to deal with scalability from a number of perspectives; addressability, testability and component composition. The book begins by defining ''scale'' from a JavaScript point of view, and dives into the influencers of scale, as well as scalable component composition and communication. We will also look at how large-scale architectures need the ability to scale down, and recover from failing components, as well as scale up and manage new features or a large user base. Filled with real-world JavaScript scaling scenarios, and code-first examples, JavaScript at Scale is your guide to building out applications that last. Each topic is covered in a way that it can be applied to your own unique scenarios; by understanding the fundamentals of a scaling issue, you''ll be able to use that knowledge to tackle even the most difficult of situations.

Then as more was expected of sites, server-side technologies like PHP became necessary. But now Rich Internet Applications (RIA) put a lot of the functionality back in the Web browser, so a server-side technology alone will no longer suffice. Developers who have been doing server-side work for years need to broaden their horizons to provide a rich client-side experience. Enter Effortless Flex 4 Development by bestselling author Larry Ullman. Flash-Flex is a powerful duo for providing a rich, client-side experience. The first third of this book covers the fundamentals of creating Flex apps. The second third is about getting, displaying, validating, and sending data: locally, remotely, and from the user. All server-side code in this book is PHP, and this data-centric view and larger support for PHP is a key focus in Flex 4. The last third is about rounding out the know-how for full application development. Taking advantage of what Flex 4 has to offer, developers can quickly learn how to create RIAs, some of which interact with PHP scripts running on the server. Adobe has open-sourced Flex and made its SDK freely available, so it is becoming more attractive to developers who prefer open-source projects over commercial ones.

Over the past three years PHP has evolved from being a niche language used to add dynamic functionality to small sites to a powerful tool making strong inroads into large-scale, business-critical Web systems. The rapid maturation of PHP has created a skeptical population of users from more traditional "enterprise" languages who question the readiness and ability of PHP to scale, as well as a large population of PHP developers without formal computer science backgrounds who have learned through the hands-on experimentation while developing small and midsize applications in PHP. While there are many books on learning PHP and developing small applications with it, there is a serious lack of information on "scaling" PHP for large-scale, business-critical systems. Schlossnagle''s Advanced PHP Programming fills that void, demonstrating that PHP is ready for enterprise Web applications by showing the reader how to develop PHP-based applications for maximum performance, stability, and extensibility.','0672333147','9780672333149',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mCpnlNYzqOQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',NULL,'en','PHP');

With XML, you can store and structure data for seamless, cross-platform exchange—which is especially crucial in today''s e-commerce environments. But XML does no processing itself. To leverage XML data, you need to use a programming language. XML Programming with Perl, Python, and PHP teaches you to reap the special advantage of processing your XML with these and four other scripting languages, which—as you''ll see—trump C, C++, and Java in a variety of ways. Along this path lie shorter development times and lower costs.

This in-depth tutorial goes beyond what is available anywhere else to teach how to write WPF, Silverlight, and Windows Phone applications using the Reactive Extensions (Rx) to handle events and asynchronous method calls. Reactive programming allows you to turn those aspects of your code that are currently imperative into something much more event-driven and flexible. For this reason, it’s sometimes referred to as LINQ for Events. Reactive programming hinges on the concept of the observable collection, as opposed to the simple enumerable collection with which we’re all familiar. For example, to extract data from a collection and add it to a list box, you would traditionally iterate through the list box, extracting each object in turn. This approach works fine, but it requires significant knowledge about the data you’re working with, which can be limiting. In Rx programming, you''re instead informed about each object in turn and then free to react to each notification however you like, which affords much greater flexibility. This book shows you how reactive programming can be applied to a range of situations—from WPF applications to Windows Phone apps—to improve coding efficiency and boost performance.','1430237481','9781430237488',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EQVkDCMB0rMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',NULL,'en','React');

When you master the material, you’ll be ready to build industrial-strength object-oriented Swift applications. About This Book ¿ The Swift™ programming language was arguably the most significant announcement at Apple’s 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference. Although apps can still be developed in Objective-C®, Apple says that Swift is its applications programming and systems programming language of the future. ¿ Swift is a contemporary language with simpler syntax than Objective-C. Because Swift is new, its designers were able to include popular programming language features from languages such as Objective-C, Java™, C#, Ruby, Python® and many others. These features include automatic reference counting (ARC), type inference, optionals, String interpolation, tuples, closures (lambdas), extensions, generics, operator overloading, functions with multiple return values, switch statement enhancements and more. We’ve been able to develop apps more quickly in Swift than with Objective-C and the code is shorter, clearer and runs faster on today’s multi-core architectures. ¿ Swift also eliminates the possibility of many errors common in other languages, making your code more robust and secure. Some of these error-prevention features include no implicit conversions, ARC, no pointers, required braces around every control statement’s body, assignment operators that do not return values, requiring initialization of all variables and constants before they’re used, array bounds checking, automatic checking for overflow of integer calculations, and more. You can combine Swift and Objective-C in the same app to enhance existing Objective-C apps without having to rewrite all the code. Your apps will easily be able to interact with the Cocoa®/Cocoa Touch® frameworks, which are largely written in Objective-C. ¿ You can also use the new Xcode playgrounds with Swift. A playground is an Xcode window in which you can enter Swift code that compiles and executes as you type it. This allows you to see and hear your code’s results as you write it, quickly find and fix errors, and conveniently experiment with features of Swift and the Cocoa/Cocoa Touch frameworks. ¿ Practical, Example-Rich Coverage of: Classes, Objects, Methods, Properties Initializers, Deinitializers, Bridging Tuples, Array and Dictionary Collections Structures, Enumerations, Closures, ARC Inheritance, Polymorphism, Protocols Type Methods, Type Properties Generics; Strings and Characters Operator Overloading, Operator Functions, Custom Operators, Subscripts Access Control; Type Casting and Checking Nested Types, Nested Methods Optionals, Optional Chaining, Extensions Xcode, Playgrounds, Intro to Cocoa Touch® with a Fully Coded iOS® 8 Tip Calculator App Overflow Operators, Attributes, Patterns More topics online ¿ IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT XCODE AND SWIFT: With Xcode 6.3 and Swift 1.2, Apple introduced several changes in Swift that affect the book''s source code.

Until recently, ASP.NET MVC was regarded as an advanced technology only suitable for experienced developers with a strong knowledge of classic ASP.NET and C# coding behind them. This book overturns that prejudice and shows that the beautiful simplicity of ASP.NET MVC is just as suitable for novice developers venturing into real-world application design for the first time. With the aid of a fully worked demo application this book explains and demonstrates for you the three pillars of MVC in action. You’ll see howthe Model, View and Controller patterns work together in a compliementary manner to provide MVC’s powerful results. There’s never been a better time to learn how to use ASP.NETMVC 4. The technology will speed your development times, reduce the verbosity of your code and simplify your application designs all at once. Take the first step towards ASP.NET MVC mastery with Beginning ASP.NET MVC 4. What you’ll learn How to get started with ASP.NET MVC. What tools and components you’ll need and how to download and set up the demo application on your system. Understand the details of the MVC pattern with deep-dives into each of the Model, View and Controller elements supported by working code showing them in action. How to apply and extend the MVC patterns to real world solutions: adding AJAX and jQuery, validation and securing user data, testing and deploying the finished application. All of these are discussed and demonstrated. Who this book is for This book is written for readers with basic ASP.NET expertise, such as you might gain from reading Beginning ASP.NET 4.5 in C#. You should be familiar with the underlying structure of ASP.NET applications and comfortable following examples that are underpinned with straight-forward C# code. If you''ve just found your feet with ASP.NET and are looking to take the next step on the road to mastery then this is the book for you.
